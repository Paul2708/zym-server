# Zym - Server
---
This project holds multiple spigot plugins for a freebuild server.

## About
The plugins are used on a subscriber-only server by [Clym](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheClym) and [Zinus](https://www.youtube.com/user/ZinusHD).
It's based on a freebuild server, but you can claim certain chunks that will be protected. The project is inspired by Craft-Attack, a german Minecraft-Project for YouTubers.

You can find a detailed description of the provided plugins in their README.
A detailed description of upcoming features can be found [here](docs.google.com/document/d/1FgQFutohcGARgRZ3Zqh0gEnn1yirxuVO_QEahMPIUGI).
